Some criteria make code objectively less readable (comment spacing as in V.C, 80 characters per line limits as in II.A); others are pointless (#include ordering as in VIII.E, trailing whitespace as in III.E, especially within comments); some are frustrating to get used to because they are radically different from past courses such as CS180 (IV.A being two space indentation rather than tab, VI requiring parentheses around logical subexpressions); and still others are subjective and never enforced in context (I.B regarding ""descriptive and meaningful names"" and XII.C regarding variable scope and definition). I hope that at some point soon the reasoning for the detail of many--if not all--of these rules be reconsidered and updated. ","I am in favor of the existence of a code standard, because it is important that the flow of code be visible through comments and whitespace; what I am not in favor of are code standards that are radically different from the one used by many of these students just a semester earlier, and code standards that micromanage code such that there's only one way to solve a problem.

I understand that it is supposed to emulate a compiler output but the previous linter output was significantly easier to read and understand what the problem is and what standard is being violated.","For some reason it seems like the linter has 2 standards that kind of battle with each other and end up requiring a code change that looks ridiculous. The code standards are the no following white spaces and whitespaces after separating commas. If a comma is the last character of a line that needs shortened due to line length these 2 standards cause issues. The only way that I have found to satisfy both is as follows:

function(arg1, arg2, arg3
                , arg4, arg5);

which looks ridiculous but I haven't found a better looking and consistent fix to this problem.

Follow up issue I have with the code standard, what is the issue with the following whitespace? Why does it matter? It doesn't effect readability in any way and if it doesn't cause issues with line length why would the existence of a space at the end of a line cause any issues what so ever.","Yes BUT a very loose one. The coding standard for this course is honestly ridiculously complex. I understand that it is to try and improve readability of the code and make it look more professional but for me personally I whole heartedly believe that my code looks more professional and readable before I have to make 30 changes to formatting. And sometimes I run into issues were it complains about a line being too long and there is no simple way for me to short that line and still be readable so I end up having to go and abbreviate variable names to try and shave off a few characters. 

I understand that there are people that need some sort of standard for when they write code to make it look coherent, but to the people that write good looking, professional, AND WORKING code but follow a slightly different set of rules. It is extremely frustrating to then have to go back and modify the look of the code just slightly to meet some imaginary standard that has nothing to do with the functionality of the code in any way.","The code standard needs to be changed to be less strict and more based in logic and reality 
(or removed all together) because it doesn't always have the intended outcome if multiple standards conflict with each other. It just makes the programmer's life more miserable after making functional code."

If there is one thing being counted in a function and u call it counter, anyone with a simple level of competence should know what it's counting. taking points off for things like var1, var2 etc. makes sense but things like counter, tokens, etc. seems too harsh. ","No, basic coding style adherence makes sense. Don't go over 80, comments when necessary, things like that are appropriate. However, the second you spend an unnecessary amount of time worrying over the code standard grade and have to take more time ""cleaning code"" to match someone else's standard, then I think it's a bit overboard. There is such a thing as overdoing it and if the code standard starts to inhibit the way you write code, than I think it is a bit excessive. Particularly because we get a grade, if you plan on taking points off for variables names, like someone in the class used tot_count and was marked off for that, (Again, anyone with a simple understanding of coding would know that means total count.) then you might want to consider at this point what you are even grading us on. Clearly that has nothing to do with our ability to read/write/understand code, I suggest that if the standard is this meticulous then you consider not grading it or at the least giving feedback on the mistakes but not putting it in the gradebook. It's not really fair that a class like this where we learn about such complicated concepts would drop our grade over something like the name of our variable, even when we get everything else right.

I always was curious though what a ""malformed"" header comment was though as I was never able to resolve that error despite reading through the course coding standard numerous times.",The code standard is not described in detail in the actual course website making it a very obscure standard to adhere to. There was a lot of guesswork that I had to do to try and get full points on the coding standard and moreover find it a tad unreasonable how many times i was marked off points for relatively small things like having to justify why a variable name made sense to me. ,"Yes I am, though I liked the command that I could run in Intellij when I was in CS 180. Coding is already hard in the terminal, especially for people who are taking this class as their second programming class ever. ","There was a lot I feel Professor Tursktra did not take into account of when teaching this course. The first lecture I sat in class on material was about terminal flags and then File I/O which was blindsiding as someone who had literally just come out of their first programming class ever. The tone of the class always seemed like the professor was ""discussing"" curriculum among peers that knew exactly what he was talking about rather than students who are possibly seeing this for the first time ever."
